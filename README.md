Running

- have docker and uv installed, then clone repo and run uv sync, after they're installed cd into the folder and activate the venv
- current server.py works with test_grader.py, test_run.py, and test_task.json
- in order to run, just run hud dev --build in one terminal and run python test_run.py in another terminal (make sure you're inside the venv created by uv)
